\section{Foreword}
Welcome to QC Paulinesia!

This book started its life as Ref.\cite{origin}, a 53 page pedagogical paper that I published at arXiv in 2004. On June 2020,
I decided to reformat it as a book and 
upload it to github. I will
try to improve it and enlarge it 
in the future.

This book is not 
intended to
cover all of quantum computing. In particular, the 2 famous, seminal algorithms by Shor and Grover, are not covered. Neither is Quantum AI.
Neither are matters related to qc hardware. 
So far, this is just an introduction
to quantum gate
maths from an uncommon perspective.
